# drumKit


This is a simple but fun website!!! 

there are various components of a drum on the webpage. 
Each component is matched to a letter on the keyboard 
(each component can also be clicked) 



This website was built to test my knowledge of the DOM as well as events and event handling 

see the deployment on github pages. 

thank you !!
